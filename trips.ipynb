    "A Pythagorean triple is three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ representing the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse $c$. This means that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, which we'll refer to as the Pythagorean equality. We will require that all three sides are less than some specified maximum value $m$, and for uniqueness we'll also require that $a < b < c \\leq m$. Also, triples should be primitive â€” not a multiple of another triple. Much more information on Pythagorean Triples can be found in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple)."
